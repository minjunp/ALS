Abstractâ€” Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor
neuron disease that gradually weakens muscle functionality.
Unfortunately, there is no cure for the disease; it is imperative
to treat the patients accordingly to the disease stage. The goal
of this research to find a generalizable model that summarizes
functional rating scores reported by patients over 12 months
period. We registered the data by aligning the longitudinal
curves across the length of symptom duration. After curve
registration, we grouped patients into subgroups based on
each symptom duration. We found that patients with longer
symptom duration report lower functional rating scores, and
within subgroups, we applied clustering method and identified
the trends for the disease progression.
